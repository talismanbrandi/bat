This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed in the system.

The example calculates the signal reference prior and posterior for a
counting experiment following JINST 7 (2012) P01012 [arXiv:1108.4270].

It demonstrates how to write your own priors inheriting from BCPrior.

The files:
----------

   Makefile               - makefile for the example program
   ReferenceCounting.h    - definition of the counting model
   ReferenceCounting.cxx  - source code of the counting class
   RefPrior.h             - definition of the reference prior
   RefPrior.cxx           - source code of the reference prior
   GammaDistPrior.h       - definition of Gamma distribution prior
   GammaDistPrior.cxx     - source code of the Gamma distribution prior


Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

	For the compilation to work properly, the script bat-config needs
	to be accessible, for example by adding its directory to the PATH
	environment variable.

4. Run the executable 'runReferenceCounting.cxx'
